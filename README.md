# DnD Character Generator

A DnD character generator made with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org). Currently only 3.5 is supported. The logic for this character generator is based on [Ed Friedlander MD's character generator](http://www.pathguy.com/cg35.htm). The [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com) configuration for this project is based heavily on (read "copied wholesale from") [Gulp Starter](https://github.com/vigetlabs/gulp-starter).
